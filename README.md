## User Story
As an investor 
I want to see relevant data
so that I can make more informed decisions. This gives new or old investers a platform to check out the latest stock options and features.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given that i need to look up different companies 
When type in a ticker symbol for a specific company
Then i get information from that company


With these points in mind, in this project we will set our yourself up for future success by applying the core skills we've recently learned: Bootstrap, media queries, java and CSS,  variables.
